# `zagent doctor`

Health checks + quick fixes for the gateway and channels.

## Examples

```bash
zagent doctor
zagent doctor --repair
zagent doctor --deep
```

Notes:
- Interactive prompts (like keychain/OAuth fixes) only run when stdin is a TTY and `--non-interactive` is **not** set. Headless runs (cron, Telegram, no terminal) will skip prompts.
- `--fix` (alias for `--repair`) writes a backup to `~/.zagent/zagent.json.bak` and drops unknown config keys, listing each removal.

## macOS: `launchctl` env overrides

If you previously ran `launchctl setenv ZAGENT_GATEWAY_TOKEN ...` (or `...PASSWORD`), that value overrides your config file and can cause persistent “unauthorized” errors.

```bash
launchctl getenv ZAGENT_GATEWAY_TOKEN
launchctl getenv ZAGENT_GATEWAY_PASSWORD

launchctl unsetenv ZAGENT_GATEWAY_TOKEN
launchctl unsetenv ZAGENT_GATEWAY_PASSWORD
```
